# 📄 Sahil’s Resume Graveyard ⚰️✨  

Welcome to the holy archive of **every resume I’ve ever sacrificed to the ATS gods**.  
Each version here represents me tweaking fonts, rewording bullet points, and pretending I cracked the secret formula to a **100/100 ATS score**.  

- **`Sahil Sureka.pdf` → The latest masterpiece (probably still being rejected somewhere right now).**  
- **`Resume(mm-yy).pdf` → My past experiments in the art of “beating the bots.”**  

This repo is basically **GitHub for my career drafts**:  
- Every commit = “Fixed one typo, lost two opportunities.”  
- Every update = “Surely THIS version will pass ATS.”  
- Every file = A résumé-shaped coping mechanism.  

Enjoy the evolution of my job-hunting journey 🎢💼
